label chapter3:

    "Summer vacation time is always fast, and in a blink of an eye, a new semester has arrived."
    "It is customary for Missy to give a meeting to all students on the first day of the new term."
    Missy "Hello everyone, I hope all of you had a great holiday."
    Missy "Most people should have been restricted from travelling due to the covid-19."
    Missy "However, with the improvement of the epidemic,"
    Missy "travel restrictions have all been canceled for the new term!"
    Missy "In the new semester, to make up for not travelling in the summer vacation."
    Missy "The university offers an exchange programme for our majors."
    Missy "All students are welcome!"
    Missy "You will go to universities around the world for 3 months of study."
Missy "Students are welcome to actively apply!
Kevin "Do you want to take part?
Mys "I'm super tempted!
Mys "It was always my dream to go to Von Neumann University (the best computer university in the world).
Kevin "Then we'll go!
Missy "I've already heard from some students that they really want to go.
Missy "But before you sign up, I would like to remind you about the safety of the placement.
Mys "I have a question, what is a placement?
Missy "Placement involves transferring your supervision to a third party placement provider who is usually said to be another organisation.
Missy "It is clear that exchange learning is a placement.
Missy "Many of the school's activities are part of the placement.
Missy "If the activity is a placement, you must apply to the school and wait for its approval.
Mys "If the school doesn't approve me to attend, or if I don't submit an application, can I still attend?
Missy "Then you can't take part, so please remember to always submit an application! So you need to be able to tell what activities fall under placement.

Missy "The safety of our students is always our primary concern, even when your supervision is diverted
Mys "What do I need to be aware of regarding the security of my placement?
Missy "There are three main stages of security in resettlement "before, during and after resettlement.
Missy "The main thing that schools may ask you to provide after placement is "reports on standard templates or electronic questionnaires
Missy "Or the school may ask you to share your experiences for the following year's students.
Missy "The focus of placement safety is pre and post placement.

Missy "Before placing, you first need to consider the practicality of the placement.
Practicality means do you need a visa or other travel document? Is your passport valid? Can you arrange appropriate health and travel insurance? How will you travel around during your placement and where will you stay? Will you have enough money to cover the costs of your placement and will you be able to access additional funds in case of an emergency? Considering all of these and more will help ensure that everything you need is in place before you leave Manchester.

You then need to consider the risks in 6 ways "your work
Your travel and transport, your location and/or area, your general/environmental health
Your personal traits, characteristics, abilities, your insurance arrangements

-Your work
First you need to consider the risks at your job. They include the nature of the work hazards you may be exposed to, such as sharp objects, tools, hazardous chemicals or potentially dangerous people or animals.
-Your travel and transport
Depending on the nature and location of the placement, you may also face significant health, safety and welfare issues associated with travelling to and from the placement and to and from your accommodation. You should consider the hazards and benefits of different types of public transport, self-driving, walking or cycling.
-Your location and/or region
The location of the placement can have a considerable impact, especially if it is located in an area or country/region that you are unfamiliar with. You should also be aware of the local culture, for example, to understand which standards of dress and behaviour are acceptable and which may cause offence.
-Your - general/environmental health
You may face significant health, safety and welfare issues related to the environmental conditions in your workplace or general location, your accommodation or your food and drink. Consider - under the prevailing climate, look for reviews about where you will be staying and try to find advice on where to eat and where to avoid.
-Your personal traits, characteristics, abilities
Your personal health, knowledge, skills, experience and personality may have an impact on your health and safety in a particular environment.
-Your insurance arrangements
You may need to obtain travel and medical insurance prior to making your placement. Make sure you consider and understand the scope and limitations of your insurance to ensure you are fully covered.

Missy "In placement, - you should be in regular contact with your workplace supervisor. Communicate with your school on a regular basis.
You should also establish emergency contact arrangements.


Place the preminigame and match the 6 examples to the factors.
Missy "Before you submit your application, we need to know if you can correctly identify these 6 factors.
Missy "You will only be able to make a more comprehensive plan if you can make the right judgement.

Missy "Please choose carefully, if you do not pass the test, you will not be able to participate in the exchange programme.
Missy "I will give a few scenarios below, please decide which factor they belong to and whether they are appropriate or not

The school has arranged for you to carry out relevant experiments in the laboratory of a chemical company Not suitable for your job
Because we are computer science students, it is very dangerous to do chemistry experiments without training

You have to pass a junction with no traffic lights and a lot of traffic every time you go from your hostel to the drop-off point, and you can only choose to walk or cycle to the drop-off point Not suitable - Your travel and transport
Intersections without traffic lights are very dangerous and there is a high risk of traffic accidents

The country you are visiting is more resistant to black clothing, so you should leave your black clothes at home. Suitable for your location and/or region
Knowing the culture of the country in advance is the right thing to do

Before you go, you should search for information about the local area. Find out about the local climate food habits etc Suitable for - your - general/environmental health
You should get to know the local conditions and daily life before you go

Make yourself more independent and stronger before you go.  Fit - your personal traits, characteristics, abilities
Our personalities always have a huge impact

We are very strong and therefore do not need to care about insurance.  Not suitable - your insurance arrangements
We should insure ourselves, accidents can happen at any time

Missy "OK, now let me see the results of your test
Missy "Score < 100/12*8 Your score is "** It's too bad you didn't pass the test.
Missy "Not passing the test means not being able to take part in the interaction programme.
Missy "If you don't pass, you can see me to take the test again.

Missy "Score > 100/12*8 Your score is "** Congratulations on passing the test, Mys you can approach me to apply for the exchange programme.

Kevin also passed the test and you ended up at the Von Neumann University (the best computer university) to study computing as interactive students.

First day at MIT

Mys "Wow, is this the best computer university in the world, it's really great!
Kevin "I can't wait to get in!
Mys "Let's get inside quickly.
There is a gate at the entrance, do we have to swipe the student card Missy gave us to get in?
Mys "It should be, the school needs the student card to verify the student's identity. Non-campus personnel always pose a security issue.
I'll give it a go then

。。。。。

Mys "How come the machine is not responding.
Kevin "Is it because our card has not been activated yet?

Mys "I don't think so, this is the one Missy sent us.
Kevin "I noticed that there was no supervision next to it, and this gate wasn't high enough for us to flip over. And there was no supervision

Option "Contact Missy to resolve the problem Missy has said to contact our school if you have a problem outside. Let's contact her first.
      Follow Kevin over the gate.   I wanted to get in so badly, it shouldn't be a problem to flip through. And we're students at the university. Only the student card doesn't work for now

Contact Missy to solve the problem
Mys "Missy our student card won't go through the entrance of the school what's going on?
Missy "I shouldn't have, I activated them myself when I gave you the student cards.
Missy "I'll check them again.
Missy "I know. The student card needs to be activated by both parties and I have contacted the staff at VON Neumann University. It should be ready in a few minutes.

Mys "Missy is fine, thank you very much.
Missy "You're welcome. Remember to contact the school if you have any difficulties out there, the school will provide you with help.
Mys "Yes!

Follow Kevin over the gates.
Kevin "It's easy to turn it over, so come on over here too.
Mys "No problem!
Mys "finally getting into the best computer university

You just rolled over and the security guard appeared
Security Guard "Stop! Who are you? Who gave you permission to go through the gates?
Mys "We are exchange students at the university, we are not bad people and we have student cards.
Security guard "Give me your student card and I'll try it.
Security "Your student card doesn't work.
Security "despite your names being on it, this could be a forgery.
Security "I'll have you arrested!
Mys "don't 。。。。

Missy "How can you go through the gates privately? Didn't I tell you to contact the school if you encounter any problems?
Missy "You'll ruin our school's reputation!
Missy "The student card needs to be activated by both parties before it can be used, and the staff at VON Neumann hadn't activated it for you when you swiped it!
Missy "You should have contacted me!

Kevin "I'm sorry.
Mys "It won't happen next time

Missy "There is no more next time for you, this is your last exchange student program. You will be banned from future activities.
Mys "Don't...
Missy "Also you will be fined £5,000 by the local police!
Missy "It's your choice

After paying the fine at the police station



Mys "We're in, finally.
Kevin "Yes, we must have a good tour of the campus

You then begin your studies at the VON Neumann University.
Yet life is not always peaceful.
On this day you are using the computer in the computer building to study as usual.

Mys "Wait, why did this computer suddenly go black for me?
Kevin "Look, the computer screen shows a line that reads
Kevin "You have been poisoned, to detoxify please pay £300! Do not turn off your computer, or your computer will be destroyed.
Mys "What should I do? Why don't I try turning it off?
Kevin "The word on the computer screen says not to turn it off.
Mys "So maybe the hackers tricked us? I don't think they're that good at it. He's scaring me.
I thought it would be better to inform the supervisor in charge of us at the VON Neumann University.
Option "Shutdown Reboot solves 100% of the problem!
      Notify supervisor Makes sense, as the best computer university in the world, they must have excellent firewalls on their computers. If hackers can break it, then they must be pretty good at technology

Shutdown "Mys "Wow, the computer really won't open! What to do. All my data is in there.
Kevin "Notify the supervisor quickly!

Mys "Supervisor my computer is poisoned and it won't open, which means our firewall is vulnerable!
Mys "Hackers may have access to our information.
Supervisor "Yes, I understand. Please remember to let me know if you encounter any problems in school.
Supervisor "We will check and close the loopholes immediately
Mys "Can that computer still be repaired?
Supervisor "I don't think so, they are very skilled. If there's any of your homework in there, I'm afraid you'll have to redo it.
Mys "Oh my God. Help.
Notify the supervisor

Mys "Supervisor, my computer has been poisoned and I'm afraid to operate it casually. Our system is flawed!
Luckily you informed me in time and I'm sending the staff to search it. See if you can fix it.
。。。。
Supervisor "We've found the vulnerability and your computer should work now.
Mys "Thanks so much!
Supervisor "I would also like to thank you, if you had not informed us in time, all the computers in our school might have been poisoned. It would have caused a lot of damage by then.
Supervisor "Please remember to let me know in the first instance if you have any questions.
Mys "no problem

After the viral crisis, you decide to go to the window to get some fresh air and relax your brain.
You open the tiktok at the window.
Mys "hahaha, this video is too funny.
A sudden gust of wind blows by and you lose your grip on your phone and drop it.
Mys "Oh my god! I'm so unlucky.
You rush downstairs to check your phone.
Mys "It's finished, it's completely broken.
Kevin "Looks like you need a new phone.
Mys "Damn! The phone card is also broken.
Kevin "Come on, I'll walk you to get a new phone and a mobile phone card.

Electronic Market
Mys "Ok, this is the phone I want.
Kevin:Next it's time for the mobile phone number.
Mys "Wow, 1111111111, that's definitely a really great mobile number!
Kevin "Indeed, very memorable!
Mys "Then it's decidedly it.
Mys "OK, we're done shopping, let's go!
Kevin "Are you forgetting something?
What is it?
You should update your contact details at missy
You must also ensure that the University provides you with up-to-date contact information on Campus Solutions and knows how to contact you in the event of an emergency during your placement. You should also ensure that you check your email regularly while away from the University.

But it's not our country's mobile phone card, so I'll go back and replace it.
You should replace it immediately, it's very important!
I really don't think there's anything wrong with changing to a fixed mobile number when I go back. This one is only temporary.
Option "Update I should update. The contact details must be up to date.
      I don't want to update it now, but I have to update it when I go back to Manchester, so it's a hassle. I don't usually use my mobile number, I just send an email.


Updated.
Mys "ok, I'm done updating.
You got a call from missy just after your phone was updated.
Mys "hi, missy. what a coincidence, I just updated my phone number.
I've been calling your original number for a long time and have been unable to get through.
Thank God you have updated your contact details.
Then you should thank kevin, who convinced me to update it.
I now have something very urgent to inform you about.
A variant of the New Coronavirus has appeared in your area!
Our country wants to guarantee our safety by interrupting flights with the country you are in within 72 hours!
You need to come back immediately!
Otherwise there's no telling when we'll be back!

Oh my goodness, I get it.
Thank you!
It's still very important to keep your contact details open!

Not updated.
kevin "Well, it's your choice and I respect that.

On this night
You hear a heavy knock on the door.
Kevin "Mys, Mys, wake up, something big is happening!
Mys "I'm so sleepy, it's 2am. What's going on.
Kevin "I just got a call from missy
Kevin "Missy says we have a local variant of the New Coronavirus!
Kevin "Our country is going to interrupt flights with the country you are in within 72 hours as a way of keeping us safe!
Kevin "We need to go back immediately! Otherwise we don't know when we'll be back!

Oh my goodness, I get it.
Don't forget to update your contact details, Missy can't reach you. She is very anxious.
Good good.

After the update
Missy "Mys, what the hell were you thinking?
Missy "Why don't you update your contact details. I'm going crazy.

Mys "I don't feel the need to update this number and I won't use it when I go back.
Missy "This idea is wrong!
Missy "You should keep your contact details open at all times.
Mys "I understand, missy, and I'm very sorry
Missy "Kevin told you, didn't he?

Mys "I've got it. We'll go back tomorrow.

Finally you made it back to Manchester without incident.
Everything went well in your later university life. You ended up finishing your studies successfully and finding the right job. Life has been on top ever since.
